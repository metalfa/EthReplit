# Greendizer 0.0.3
This is a project to help a nation to be finatially free by providing a decentralized peer to peer cummunication solutions. 

Features include:
- Hot reloading
- Solidity error checking
- Deploying multiple contracts
- UI for testing out contracts
- Replit testnet + faucet

## Getting started

- `contract.sol` will automatically recompile whenever you edit it, and all your contracts inside of this file will be available to deploy from the UI.

- Pressing `cmd-s` or `ctrl-s` (windows) will reload the UI.

We have preinstalled packages from `@openzeppelin/contracts`. To install other solidity packages that are distributed on npm, make sure you install them using the Package Installer ðŸ“¦ in the sidebar

## Examples

We included a few example contracts in the `examples` folder. These will not be automatically deployed or accessible in the UI, but you can copy / paste them into your main `contract.sol` file or import them. They're there for your reference!

## Future work

We're working on some other features for making development here a lot easier, which are included, but not limited to:

- LSP support for solidity
- Integration with hardhat for "local" (in-repl) testing
- An actual solidity REPL for quickly prototyping / testing functions or lines.
